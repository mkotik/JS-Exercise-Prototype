        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.

          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. Window Binding is what happens if you use 'this' without context. It will by default reference the window object. Unless you have strict mode enabled. In that case, 'this' would return undefined

    2. Implicit binding is the most common use of 'this'. When you use 'this' in an object method, it will refer to the object it is a part of.

    3. Explicit binding is when you use .call, .bind, or .apply . In these situations, you have to explicity define what 'this' will refer to in the argument for one of these methods. For example: function.call(referenceObject)

    4. New binding is when you use the 'new' constructor word. Any references of 'this' inside of the the constructor word will refer to the object you are constructing.
